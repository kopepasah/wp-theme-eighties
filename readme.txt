I am a modern, progressively enhanced theme designed to keep your content front and center.

== Description ==

Hello, my name is Eighties and I am a modern, progressively enhanced theme designed to keep your content front and center. My menu and sidebar are built to stay out of the way until a user wants to see them. When clicked, users get a nice clean overlay. You can upload a custom header image or select to use the featured image of the post as the header image. Both you and your site's visitors will love me and you can expect updates and future enhancements for years to come (because my maker loves me, too).

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Nothing right now, but ask away!

== License ==

Eighties is GPL v2.0 or later license. :) Use it to make something cool.
